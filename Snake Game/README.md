I have made the classic snake game with graphics in python

Steps I took to make the game:
1. Import libraries
2. Made a class called Snake
3. Inatilazie Variables and Load the Graphics and Sound
4. Draw out the Snake
5. Print the Snake Head 
6. Print the Snake Tail
7. Move the Snake
8. Add blocks to the Snake
9. Plays the Crunch Sound
10. Reset the Snake after it dies
11. Made a class called Fruit
12. Inatilazie Variables and Load the Graphics
13. Draw out the Fruit
14. Randomizes the Fruit
15. Made a class called Main
16. Inatilazie Variables
17. Run the functions
18. Draw all the elemets
19. Check if the Snake's Head is at the same position as Fruit
20. Check if the Snake died
21. Run the reset function in Snake
22. Draw the grass
23. Draw the score
24. Fix the sound
25. Inatilize the Variables
26. Loads the font
27. Updates the screen and set the time
28. Run the Game Loop which checks playes input and prints out all the elements
